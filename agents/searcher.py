CONCEPT: Searcher Agent — Tool Use
=====================================
Pattern: Agent calls a tool, normalises results, writes to state

The searcher reads search_queries from state, calls the DuckDuckGo tool for
each query, deduplicates results by URL, and writes them back as SearchResult
TypedDicts.

What is given:
  - The import of the search tool
  - The loop skeleton (iterating over state["search_queries"])

What you must implement:
  - Calling the tool: results = web_search(query)  ← returns a list of dicts
  - Mapping raw dicts to SearchResult TypedDicts (title, url, snippet keys)
  - Deduplication: skip URLs already seen in this run
  - Return {"search_results": [...]}

Tool call hint:
  web_search is imported from tools.web_search. After your TODO in that file,
  it returns List[dict] where each dict has keys: title, url, snippet.
  You construct SearchResult(title=..., url=..., snippet=...) for each one.

Dedup hint:
  Keep a set of seen URLs. Before appending a result, check if its URL is in
  the set. If not, add to set AND append to results list.

State fields read:   search_queries
State fields written: search_results
